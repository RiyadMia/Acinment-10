      <h2>1. Difference between authorization and authentication ?</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>. Authorization</h3>
      <p>01. Authorization determines what resources a user can access.</p>
      <p>
        02. Authorization works through settings that are implemented and
        maintained by the organization.
      </p>
      <p>03. Authorization always takes place after authentication.</p>
      <p>04. Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.</p>

      <h3>. Authentication</h3>
      <p>01. Authentication verifies who the user is.</p>
      <p>
        02. Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric
        information, and other information provided or entered by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        03. Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access
        management process.
      </p>
      <p>
        04. Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>02.1. What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        . Authentication is used by a server when the server needs to know
        exactly who is accessing their information or site
      </p>
      <p>
        . Authentication is used by a client when the client needs to know that
        the server is system it claims to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        . In authentication, the user or computer has to prove its identity to
        the server or client.
      </p>
      <p>
        . Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and
        password. Other ways to authenticate can be through cards, retina scans,
        voice recognition, and fingerprints.
